# Hi, I'm Adelina 👋

I'm a **Frontend Developer** and **UI/UX Designer**, currently in my **2nd year at the Technical University of Moldova**.  
I love combining university work with personal projects — always learning, building, and improving along the way.

🌿 I’m a big fan of **new knowledge**, curiosity, and the little discoveries you get while working on something new.  
🎲 Outside of coding/design, I enjoy **board games** and **late-spring picnics**.

## ✨ What I’m working on
- Frontend projects (interactive UIs, responsive layouts, clean code)
- UI/UX case studies and design systems
- University assignments + team projects

## 📌 Projects
Here you’ll find my **university** and **personal projects**, grouped and documented as I go.  
I’m at the start of a journey full of challenges and new possibilities — and I’m excited to grow through every project.
